# pytorch tutorial
## author: rohan singh
this repository contains code for the pytorch library in python. the code is divided into different directories based on what you can use them for.  

## code
the code is divided into:  
  - **basics:** simple pytorch stuff with tensors and operations.  
  - **neural networks:** using pytorch neural networks.  
  - **pre-trained models:** using pretrained pytorch models form the api.  
  - **graph models:** pytorch code for different graph convulational networks.
